# curve25519 #
Verilog 2001 of the Curve25519 elliptic curve based function.

## Status
Just started, very little work has been done. **Do. Not. Use**.

## Introduction
The purpose of this repo is to provide an open hardware implementation of Curve25519 function
as needed to do both DH and Ed operations.

The idea is (was) to base the implementation on the curve25519-donna code.
